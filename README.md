## Facial Recognition Similarity

Deep Learning-Based Face Recognition & Verification

Overview
This project implements facial recognition similarity using deep learning techniques. It utilizes pre-trained VGG-Face models and DeepFace to analyze, compare, and verify faces based on their embeddings. The model processes images, extracts facial features, and determines if two faces belong to the same person.

## Features

- Face Detection ‚Äì Detects faces in images using pre-trained models.
- Face Embeddings ‚Äì Converts faces into numerical vectors for comparison.
- Face Verification ‚Äì Compares two faces using cosine similarity.
- Pre-trained Weights ‚Äì Uses vgg_face_weights.h5 to improve performance.
- Support for Kaggle Datasets ‚Äì Allows downloading datasets directly from Kaggle.
